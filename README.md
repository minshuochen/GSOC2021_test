# GSOC2021_test

## Test Tasks

- Easy: Based on [1], implement an optimal adaptive trial design using existing LP solvers in R. Test it on a small size problem. 

- Medium: Add some Bayes risk constraints and increase the problem size. 

- Hard: Since the core code should be implemented in C/C++. Write a simple package implementing Matrix multiplication. The main code should use C/C++.
